Stata code for linking partners in Current Population Survey (CPS) data.


## About CPS data

The Current Population Survey is a a nationally-representative survey covering over 65,000 households and their residents every month, conducted by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The publicly-available, integrated, and harmonized data is available via [IPUMS-CPS, University of Minnesota](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/).

The CPS is administered at the household-level, and collects detailed information about every person in the household. This makes it possible to identify and link people by their relationship to one another, including married as well as cohabitating couples. This code (Stata 14) identifies and links information about married and cohabiting couples.
